# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple well known game ,we often play this game in classrooms ,hostles etc. with our friends.
We call this by "zero-cross".
To make it more intresting i will prefer the following steps to follow: 
a) First we have to put some value in a chart or we can say in a matrix.
b) Then, we have to user name two always. And accordingly they choose their preferred 0 or X
c) one of them will start by inputting their values.
d) Remember value of same sign should be matched either horizontally or vertically or diagonally.
e) If user finds perfect match ,then this user wins.
